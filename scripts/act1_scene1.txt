POINT A: “Meet Inga”

INGA is seen sitting in a CHAIR at HOUSE RIGHT. She is reading a MAGAZINE. GREG BRIGGS is three seats in front of her. FRIEDRICK HURTMAN is several seats in front of him, OFFSCREEN. Past him are the TOURISTS, and SHAMUS. Most of the remaining seats are filled by COMMUTERS. Somewhere on the wall there is a THERMOSTAT.

Enter LEVITY WHISK from HOUSE LEFT. She is pushing a CART.

LEVITY stops every three seats and asks groups of COMMUTERS if they would like anything to eat or drink. The COMMUTERS do not respond.

LEVITY stops next to INGA.

LEVITY: Excuse me miss, would you like anything to eat or drink?

INGA: Yes please! I’ll have some Tasty Nuts and a lemonade.

LEVITY: That'll be five Space Bucks.

INGA hands LEVITY the SPACE BUCKS.

LEVITY rummages in her cart and produces TASTY NUTS. She hands them to INGA, who tucks them in her PURSE. The TASTY NUTS appear in the INVENTORY.
LEVITY rummages in her cart and produces LEMONADE. She hands the LEMONADE to INGA, who drinks it and puts the EMPTY CUP in her PURSE. The CUP appears in the INVENTORY.

LEVITY: Oh, I see you’re reading “Motherland Poems Monthly!”
INGA: Yes, I just love Stanislov Slavinsky’s series about comets this month! I’m traveling now to see him read in [Space France].
LEVITY: Lucky woman! I love Stanislov’s work as well.
LEVITY: He is actually traveling on this same train to get to his reading!
LEVITY: I wish I could speak with him, but his bouncers are very insistent.
LEVITY: Enjoy your Tasty Nuts!

LEVITY continues on her rounds. When she exits at HOUSE LEFT or HOUSE RIGHT, she comes back after 60 seconds.

The PLAYER may now take control of INGA.

POINT F: “You Shall Not Pass”

Inga approaches SNEELOCK, who is currently a BOUNCER for BUSINESS CLASS. She attempts to walk through the DOOR at HOUSE LEFT. SNEELOCK steps in front of the door, blocking her.

SNEELOCK: I’m sorry Ma’am, but I can’t allow you to go through there.
INGA: Why not?
SNEELOCK: Only Silver Space Train Spacers may pass through to the Silver Spacers’ Special Spot.
SNEELOCK: You are only a Bronze Space Train Benefactor and therefore must remain in the Bronze Benefactors’ Billet.
INGA: So…business class?
SNEELOCK: Yes.
INGA: There is no way for me to get to the…what was it…
SNEELOCK: The Silver Spacers’ Special Spot?

SNEELOCK: You must possess a Silver Space Train Spacers Membership Card.
INGA: Thank you.


POINT G: “Turn Up the Heat”

Upon clicking the THEROMSTAT, the heat is turned up to 80 degrees. NICOLE walks to SNEELOCK and complains. SNEELOCK goes to turn down the THERMOSTAT, leaving the door to BUSINESS CLASS unguarded.


POINT I: "Hamster from a Baby"

(This is a connection to the next car in which you can get a message to Stanislov to get him to let you through his guards)

Upon giving the BOWL OF BEAN SOUP to SHAMUS:

SHAMUS: Wow, bean soup! I love bean soup! Thanks!

SHAMUS puts POTATO on the floor and ravages the BOWL OF BEAN SOUP. POTATO starts to run around and can be picked up when clicked while near INGA.
