Description:    This class performs all UI-related management. It is responsible for drawing UI components and managing certain events fired elsewhere in the game engine.
Notes: 

UI Life Cycle:
* Instantiation should happen as soon as possible at run time. There should only be one instance of a UI object at any given time as per the Singleton pattern (shudder)
* Eventually the UI state should default to the main menu screen.
* The UI should be responsible for all transitions to and from the main menu screen.
* The UI will manage the player inventory.
* The UI will manage the CAM.
* The UI should /only/ be destroyed at exit-time.
